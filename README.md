# Hi, I'm Salma üëã

I‚Äôm a *Cloud Engineer* and *AI Practitioner* with a passion for harnessing the power of cloud computing and artificial intelligence to solve complex challenges. Whether I‚Äôm architecting secure systems or building AI-powered tools, I thrive on collaboration, innovation, and continuous learning. When I'm off the clock, you'll find me lost in a good book, scribbling new ideas, or exploring creative digital art.
