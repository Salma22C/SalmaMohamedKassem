## 🚀 Featured Projects

 **[🗣 Voice Vault – Text-to-Speech Pipeline](https://github.com/Salma22C/awsprojects/blob/main/Voice%20Vault%20Project)**  
 Designed to convert long-form .txt documents into audio files for video content creation, this project demonstrates a practical application of serverless technologies. It uses Amazon Polly for speech synthesis and Comprehend for optional summarization.
AWS Services: Lambda, S3, Polly, Comprehend, IAM

 **[🤖 Bedrock Code Assistant API](https://github.com/Salma22C/awsprojects/tree/main/Amazon%20Bedrock%20Code%20Assistant%20API)**  
 A hands-on project to practice Amazon Bedrock concepts, this assistant transforms natural language prompts into Python code using Claude Instant. It also tackled the challenge of using API Gateway for the first time, showcasing adaptability in learning unfamiliar services.
AWS Services: API Gateway, Lambda, Bedrock

 **[📊 FinOps Dashboard – Cost Visualization](https://github.com/Salma22C/awsprojects/tree/main/Serverless%20Data%20Analytics%20and%20Visualization%20Pipeline)**  
  Built a full data analytics pipeline to visualize AWS cost data. This project involved overcoming the learning curve of integrating Athena, Glue, and QuickSight, and    reflects competence in building multi-tier, serverless analytics solutions.
  AWS Services: S3, Glue, Athena, QuickSight, Lambda

**[📷 Image Recognition Pipeline](https://github.com/Salma22C/awsprojects/tree/main/Serverless%20Image%20Recognition%20Pipeline)**  
  Implements an automated tagging system for uploaded images using Rekognition, all within a serverless architecture.
  AWS Services: Lambda, S3, Rekognition, CloudWatch

 **[🌐 Static Website Hosting with Terraform](https://github.com/Salma22C/awsprojects/blob/main/Static%20Website%20Hosting%20with%20Terraform)**  
  First-time use of Terraform to deploy a static website to S3. This Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project demonstrates initiative in mastering IaC principles, from     writing Terraform configurations to achieving a successful deployment.
   Tools: S3, Terraform, IAM

 **[🔁 Automated S3 File Copy Using AWS Lambda](https://github.com/Salma22C/awsprojects/tree/main/Lambda%20copy%20Automation)**  
  Automates file transfer between S3 buckets using Lambda. As your first Lambda-based project, it involved troubleshooting through CloudWatch logs, IAM policies, and S3 triggers—highlighting your debugging and problem-solving capabilities.
AWS Services: Lambda, S3, IAM

 **[🛡️ High Availability & Security for PHP Apps](https://github.com/Salma22C/awsprojects/tree/main/High%20Availability%20PHP%20App)**  
  Deployed a PHP web application using EC2, Multi-AZ RDS, ALB, and Auto Scaling to build a resilient, multi-tier architecture. A major challenge involved configuring health checks and launch templates to ensure instances in the Auto Scaling Group registered correctly with the Load Balancer. This project demonstrates ability to design fault-tolerant, secure cloud environments and troubleshoot deployment issues at the infrastructure level.
AWS Services: EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling Group, RDS, Security Groups
